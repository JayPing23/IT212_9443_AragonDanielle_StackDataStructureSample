Title: Palindrome Checker using a Stack Data Structure

Description:
Create a program that determines whether a user-entered string is a palindrome or not. 
This project will challenge your programming skills by implementing a stack data structure and using only basic string methods like charAt and length to check for palindromes,
without relying on built-in reversal functions. 
Gain hands-on experience with fundamental data structures and algorithms while solving a classic problem.
